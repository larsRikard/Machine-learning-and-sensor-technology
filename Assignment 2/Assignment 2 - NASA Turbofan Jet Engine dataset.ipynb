    "<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Maintenance is a general process in the industry to ensure the proper functionality and reliability of the plants and assets. In general, there are three types of maintenance strategies running in the industry: (1) corrective maintenance, (2) preventive maintenance, and (3) predictive maintenance. Corrective maintenance is the cheapest type of maintenance in which the piece of equipment runs to the point of failure. Usually, if the instrument's failure has no significant consequences, corrective maintenance can be a proper option. However, in most of the industrial applications, this is not the case and failure in one asset may lead to catastrophic situation. For instance, if a turbofan jet engine fails on the sky, the consequence is loss of humans' life. On the other hand, if the maintenance is conducted regularly and according to a pre-schedule plan, the strategy is called preventive/preventative maintenance. In turbofan jet engine, this can be done after each landing and/or before each take off. In addition, more detailed investigations are done after some amount of flight duration. </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Preventive maintenance strategy has some drawbacks where under-/over-maintenance are the most promising and inevitable ones. If the intervals between maintenance phases are too long, then there is a high risk of failure before the next maintenance time (i.e., under-maintenance). However, maintening the asset too often (i.e., over-maintenance) is not acceptable either because of imposing unnecessary costs. Predictive maintenance (PdM) is the only method that uses monitoring information for predicting failures and triggering the actions before they occur and prevents over-/under-maintenance problems. </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Interestingly, PdM is not a new approach and its origin goes back to the Second World War. In that time, a British scientist named C.H. Waddington improved the availability of the fighters and bombers from 61% to 79% by providing condition-based maintenance recommendations for the Royal Air Force. During the past two decades, machine learning techniques are the main tools for dealing with prediction of failure or calculation of the remaining lifetime of the assets. Therefore, the PdM can be defined as either a regression problem or a classification problem. </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align:justify\">In this assignment, your task is to use machine learning approches for estimating the remaining life time of turbofac jet engines which is a regression problem. The dataset you are going to use for in this assignment is a very well known public data set for asset degradation modeling from NASA. The Kaggle version of this dataset with sample codes for solving the problem are accessable through this link: <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/behrad3d/nasa-cmaps\"> https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/behrad3d/nasa-cmaps</a>.</p>"

    "<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The dataset includes Run-to-Failure simulated data from turbofan jet engines and is known as \"NASA C_MAPSS dataset\". It contains four subsets (FD001 - FD004) of different operating conditions and possible fault modes. Each dataset is further divided into training and test subsets. Each time series is from a different engine i.e., the data can be considered to be from a fleet of engines of the same type. Each engine starts with different degrees of initial wear and manufacturing variation which is unknown to the user. This wear and variation is considered normal, i.e., it is not considered a fault condition. There are three operational settings that have a substantial effect on engine performance. These settings are also included in the data. The data is contaminated with sensor noise.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The engine is operating normally at the start of each time series, and develops a fault at some point during the series. In the training set, the fault grows in magnitude until system failure. In the test set, the time series ends some time prior to system failure. The objective is to predict the number of remaining operational cycles before failure in the test set, i.e., the number of operational cycles after the last cycle that the engine will continue to operate. Also provided a vector of true Remaining Useful Life (RUL) values for the test data. </p>\n",

    " \n",
    "<p style=\"text-align:justify\">For this assignment, you are supposed to work only with dataset no. 1. For ease of use, the original datasets are modified so that you only need to import data from two CSV files in standard \",\" separated format (\"train_FD001.csv\" and \"test_FD001.csv\"). The modified files also contain the headers for more readability. A column name \"RUL\" is also added to the datasets which indicates the remaining useful life for each row of data. Note that, for each engine in the train set, RUL starts at some value and reach zero after a number of cycles. The value for RUL simply means indicates how many more cycles the engine can be run. Therefore, zero value means the engine has failed at that cycle and it is not useable any more. In the test set, however, the value of RUL does not reach zero as the engine has been stoped at some random cycle before failure. The main task is to predict the RUL at the end of each cycle based on all the information from that engine (excluding the RUL value) from same and previous cycles.</p>\n",

In a static system, for prediction of an output at each time-step, you only need the current value of features at that time-step. However, if the system is dynamic, then in addition to current values of the features, the past history of the system also affect the output at current time-step. Therefore, if your system is dynamic, your model needs to consider the past values of features in addition to their current values. This can easily be done by adding \"shifted features\" to the dataset as new features. Your last taks is to add shifted features to the dataset (for example: 2 previous values of each feature) and make new regression models (linear regression is sufficient). Compare your results with previous task. </p>\n"
