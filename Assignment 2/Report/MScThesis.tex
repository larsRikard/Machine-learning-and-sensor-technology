\chapter{Understanding the problem}
\label{ch:understanding}
The following chapter discusses and answers a few questions regarding the problem and the dataset, to better understand the following chapters.

\section{What type of problem is it?}
\label{sec:typeOfProblem}
The problem at hand is in fact a regression task. The dataset available contains monitored sensory data, with noise, and can be considered labeled. The goal is to develop a model that can predict/extrapolate the RUL (Remaining Useful Life) of turbofan jet engines.

\section{What category of machine learning is required?}
\label{sec:mlCategory}
As the dataset can be considered labeled, i.e. the columns in the dataset are labeled and have some physical meaning, the supervised learning category will be used.

\section{What does each column in the dataset represent?}
\label{sec:datasetColumns}
The dataset contains multiple columns, see figure \ref{tab:columnDescr} for brief descriptions of each column.

\begin{table}[!ht]
  \caption{Column descriptions}
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{ | m{3cm} | m{10cm} |}
    \hline
    Engine       & Identification number.                           \\ \hline
    Cycle        & Counted rotations since initialization.          \\ \hline
    Settings 1-3 & How the systems configurations change over time. \\ \hline
    Sensor 1-21  & Various sensor measurements.                     \\ \hline
    RUL          & Remaining useful life.                           \\ \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \label{tab:columnDescr}
\end{table}

\section{Features and targets}
\label{sec:featuresTargets}
Attributes are data types in the dataset that reflect the name of configured or measured values such as voltage set on a motor or pressure. Features are attributes bundled with a value. Targets are usually the information that is intended to predict. In this case features are all configuration and sensory data and the target is the RUL.

\section{Not features or targets}
\label{sec:notFeaturesTargets}

Identification columns aren't features if they are all the same brand and make of fan.
Time might be a feature.

\chapter{Data Visualization}
\label{ch:visualization}
This chapter contains visualizations of the dataset that can be used to get better understanding of the system.

\section{Histogram}
\label{sec:histogram}
All the available data was plotted, see figure \ref{fig:rawHistogram}.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{AttributeHistogram}
  \caption{Histogram plot of all attributes.}
  \label{fig:rawHistogram}
\end{figure}

\chapter{Preprocessing and feature selection}
\label{ch:preprocessing}
This chapter discusses the dataset plotted in the previous chapter.*

\section{Feature removal}
\label{sec:featureRemoval}

Low correlation with feature:
The engine (id) attribute is again not a feature or a target, and we can see that most engines have similar amounts of data points, engine attribute can safely be removed.

Highly correlated:
Cycle and RUL are almost identical in terms of value frequency, which isn't strange since these are opposites, we should only use one of them. 

High difference between feature values:
Setting 2 and sensor 17 display gaps between recorded data. This may or may not be an issue.

Constant value:

Setting 3 and sensors 1, 5, 6, 10, 16, 18, 19, all have constant or close to constant values throughout the whole dataset. These should be removed.

Remaining attributes:
Cycle or RUL, setting 1, 2, sensor 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 20, 21.

% The bibliography should be displayed here...
%\printbibliography[heading=bibintoc]
% You rather like to call the bibliography "References"? Then use this instead:
\printbibliography[heading=bibintoc, title={References}]


\appendix
%%\renewcommand{\appendixname}{Paper} %% So we get 'Paper X' displayed instead
%
%
%\chapter[Short Title of Paper A]{Title of Paper A (probably very long and therefore not good to have in the header)}
%\label{paper-a}
%
%\paragraph{Note}
%Since some papers tend to have a rather long title it is good to provide the optional short title which then will be displayed in the table of contents and header instead of the long original title.
%On the openening page of the chapter the orginal \emph{long} title will be displayed.\bigskip
%
%\emph{Short descriptive text of paper follows here.}\bigskip
%
%The paper itself needs to be included in the published form as PDF on the next pages.
%This can be done using the \texttt{pdfpages} package by adding the command:
%
%\begin{verbatim}
%\includepdf{pages=-,openright}{Filename}
%\end{verbatim}
%
%You can omit the \texttt{.pdf} when specifying the \texttt{Filename}. Also you should include always include the option \texttt{openright} since it would look strange to have the paper starting at the back of the cover page.
%
%There are more options like only adding specific pages:
%\begin{verbatim}
%\includepdf{pages=2-6,openright}{Filename.pdf}
%\end{verbatim}
%
%For more options see Appendix~\ref{paper-b} where the most important pages of the \texttt{pdfpages} manual were inlcuded using \texttt{pdfpages}.
%
%
%%%% Command to include a PDF file directly including all pages:

\label{paper-a}
%Short descriptive text of paper follows here.
