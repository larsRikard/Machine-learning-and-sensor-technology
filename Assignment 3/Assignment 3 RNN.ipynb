    "Mechanical measuring devices are called thermomoeters and measure temperature due to variation of density. The Bourbon gauge can be used to measure the pressure which can be translated to a temperature by the means of equations such as the ideal gas law.\n",
    " \n",
    "Electric measurements are possible due to the Seebeck effect, which states that a voltage will be generated due to difference of temperature in different junctions of a curcuit. But the measurement is also dependent on the temperature gradient of the wires.\n",
    " \n",
    "Q: Explain the difference between systematic and random errors. What are the typical sources of these two types of error?\n",
    "A: Random error is related to the precision of the measurement. The error can be described as a stochastic distribution and can't be fully removed. Filtering and/or redundant sensor fusion can be used to decrease random error. The source of this type of error is due to precision limitations of equipment.\n",
    "Systematic error are due to other measureable disturbances that affect the system. It can be due to heat exchange within wires or change in environment, things affecting the seebeck effect. This error can be compensated by reducing heat conductivity in wires or introduce additional temperature measurements.\n",
